The Notes Manager App is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This application allows users to securely register, log in, and manage their personal notes. Users can create, view, update, and delete notes, with each note containing a title, content, and an optional image. Only authenticated users can access their own notes, and JWT-based authentication ensures secure access along with automatic token expiry handling. New users must verify their email via a verification link sent during the signup process.

On the frontend, the app offers a responsive and user-friendly interface built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap. Users can navigate through a dashboard where they can manage their notes efficiently. Additional features include a dark mode toggle, the ability to search notes by title or tags, and support for image uploads.

The backend, developed with Node.js and Express.js, provides secure RESTful APIs for handling all note-related operations and authentication workflows. The application uses MongoDB as its database, and image files can be stored either locally or using a service like Cloudinary.

This project is version-controlled with Git and hosted publicly on GitHub. It follows best practices such as meaningful commit messages, use of feature branches, and clear documentation. Setup instructions, environment variable examples, and all necessary configuration details are included to help developers run the project locally. Future enhancements may include advanced search filters, improved tagging and categorization of notes, and enhanced user interface features.
